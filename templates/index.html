			We are sick of not receiving updates shortly after

			integrated into Android and iOS. That's why we are

			free software mobile OS that is modeled after
			traditional Linux distributions. With privilege
			separation in mind. Let's keep our devices useful and

			We avoid Android's build system entirely. Instead of building a
			monolithic system image for each and every device, the whole OS
			is divided into small packages. These same package binaries can
			be installed on all devices that share the same CPU
			architecture. Device specific parts are kept as minimal as
			possible, ideally there is only one
			<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Device_specific_package">device package</a>.
			In practice there is often the
			<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Downstream_kernel_specific_package">downstream Linux kernel</a>
			too, but we are replacing those with
			<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Mainlining">Mainline</a>
			wherever possible. In the spirit of most other Linux
			distributions,
			<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Category:Interface">multiple user interfaces</a>
			from independent projects are packaged for postmarketOS, such as
			<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Plasma_Mobile">Plasma Mobile</a>,

			and <a href="https://sr.ht/~mil/Sxmo/">Sxmo</a>.

	postmarketOS is based on
	<a href="https://alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>, which is so	tiny
	(less than 10 MB in size) that development of pmOS can be done quickly
	on <i>any</i> Linux distribution. We install Alpine in multiple chroots
	to cross compile packages, build and flash postmarketOS, run it in a VM
	with <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/QEMU">QEMU</a> or
	interactively
	<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device">port new hardware</a>.
	All with our lightweight Python program
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap">pmbootstrap</a>,
	without installing anything on the host system. Writing packages is
	easy, by the way: as long as you know how to write shell scripts, you
	are good to go. We have continuous integration in place that makes sure
	everything builds that gets submitted to
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/">our packages repository</a>,
	among other sanity checks.
	<br>
	<br>
	The above design decisions make it feasible to keep the system
	up-to-date, for all devices at once! Compared to Android, it makes
	development more efficient and democratic:
	<a href="/blog/2017/12/31/219-days-of-postmarketOS/#binary-repository">you don't need to afford a powerful and expensive PC</a>
	to rebuild the entire OS. Just build the tiny part that you are
	interested in modifying.
	<br>
	<br>
	Speaking of modifying, due to the free software nature of the project,
	you can change pretty much everything. We don't even require running
	proprietary Android userspace drivers. In fact all proprietary
	components (even the WLAN, cellular modem and bluetooth firmware) are
	optional and you are asked whether you want to include them in your
	installation.
