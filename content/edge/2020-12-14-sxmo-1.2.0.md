title: "sxmo: conflict in 1.2.0 upgrade"
date: 2020-12-14

In the Sxmo 1.2.0 upgrade, `sxmo-xdm` has been replaced with `xdm`. This
results in conflicts while installing packages:

```
ERROR: xdm-1.1.12-r3: trying to overwrite etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess owned by sxmo-xdm-1.1.12-r0.
ERROR: xdm-1.1.12-r3: trying to overwrite etc/X11/xdm/Xresources owned by sxmo-xdm-1.1.12-r0.
ERROR: xdm-1.1.12-r3: trying to overwrite etc/X11/xdm/Xservers owned by sxmo-xdm-1.1.12-r0.
...
```

After the upgrade, run:

```
$ sudo apk fix
```
