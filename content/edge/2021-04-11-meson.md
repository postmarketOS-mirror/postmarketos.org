title: "meson binary missing"
date: 2021-04-11
---
A recent update on edge caused the `meson` package to be missing the `meson`
binary. This was not intended, and causes issues when building packages which
uses the meson build system:

```
/usr/bin/abuild-meson: exec: line 5: meson: not found
```

An issue was created upstream to fix the `meson` package:
https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/12596

When a fix is applied upstream, the `meson` binary will be available again
when building packages with `pmbootstrap`.
