title: "sqlite 3.35 segfaults"
date: 2021-03-15
---

For some users, programs using sqlite3 databases (e.g. calls, contacts,
gpodder) started segfaulting after the sqlite 3.35 upgrade. This is currently
being investigated in
[pmaports#1008](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/1008) and
[aports#12524](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/12524).
Help is appreciated.

As workaround, we have downgraded sqlite to 3.34 in postmarketOS. Install
updates with GNOME software or the following command to get the downgraded
version (pkgver=9999):

```
$ sudo apk upgrade -a
```

Check which version you have installed:

```
$ apk info -vv | grep sqlite
```
