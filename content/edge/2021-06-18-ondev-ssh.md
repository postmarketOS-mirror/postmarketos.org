title: "Dedicated SSH user prompt removed to make installation less complex"
date: 2021-06-18

From now on, the on-device installer does not create a dedicated SSH user
anymore.

The original idea was to ensure that the SSH user always has a stronger
password than just a numeric PIN. However, Sxmo and Plasma Mobile already don't
require that anymore, and Phosh will follow some time soon. But more
importantly, the dedicated SSH user creates unnecessary complexity for the
user, both during the installation process and when actually using it.

It's much simpler to always disable SSH and have people follow our guide in the
wiki regarding how to enable SSH with the regular user, and how to copy the SSH
key and disable password auth.

The wiki article explains under Troubleshooting how to enable SSH for
the regular user if the installation was done with an older version.
