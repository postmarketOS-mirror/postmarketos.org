title: "tinydm 1.1.0: log file moved, bug causes crash in startup"
date: 2021-06-15
---

The log file was moved from `~/.cache/tinydm.log` to
`~/.local/state/tinydm.log`  (using `$XDG_STATE_HOME`) to adhere to XDG Base
Directory specification
([!8](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/tinydm/-/merge_requests/8)).

Due to a bug, tinydm 1.1.0 doesn't start up. The bug has been fixed in
tinydm 1.1.1. It will land in the Alpine repositories soon:

* [aports!22355](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/22355)
* [tinydm!10](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/tinydm/-/merge_requests/10)
