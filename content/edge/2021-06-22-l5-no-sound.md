title: "Librem 5: No audio after upgrading to alsa-ucm-conf 1.2.5"
date: 2021-06-22
---
A recent upgrade to `alsa-ucm-conf` 1.2.5 has broken audio on the Librem 5. At
this time there is no fix, however there is a workaround that can be achieved
by commenting out a single line in `/usr/share/alsa/ucm2/ucm.conf`:

```
$ sudo sed -i 's|Include.libgen.File|# Include.libgen.File|' /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/ucm.conf
```

If a new upgrade for `alsa-ucm-conf` is available before a proper fix is in
place, the workaround will need to be re-applied.
