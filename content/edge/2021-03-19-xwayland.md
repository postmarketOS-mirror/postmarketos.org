title: "xwayland package fails to install"
date: 2021-03-19

The `xwayland` package in Alpine Linux does not properly replace the
`xorg-server-xwayland` package as intended, this results in the following error
when performing `apk upgrade`:

```
(1/1) Installing xwayland (21.1.0-r0)
ERROR: xwayland-21.1.0-r0: trying to overwrite usr/bin/Xwayland owned by xorg-server-xwayland-1.20.10-r3.
```

This will be resolved in the following Alpine Linux merge request:
[aports#19562](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/19562).

Workarounds:

Either wait for the previously mention merge request to hit Alpine Linux, or do the following manually:

```
# apk del xorg-server-xwayland
# apk fix
```
