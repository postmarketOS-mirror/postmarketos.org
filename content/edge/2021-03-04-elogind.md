title: "elogind 246.10-r0 breakage"
date: 2021-03-04
---

In the 264.10-r0 upgrade of elogind, polkit has been disabled in Alpine. This
broke tinydm. Thanks for @dylanvanassche for creating a merge request that
will fix it:
[!18965](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/18965)

If you have upgraded to the breaking version, wait until the merge request is
merged (should happen any minute now) and new binary packages are built. Then
you can upgrade to 264.10-r1, which does not have this problem (either via
serial or [SSH](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/SSH)).

```
$ sudo apk update
$ sudo apk upgrade
```
