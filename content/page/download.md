### [#latest release#]
Official postmarketOS images are available for devices in the *main* and
*community* categories. All of them are run a
[(close to) mainline](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/(Close_to)_Mainline)
kernel. Devices in *main* are supported best. Devices in *community* are well
maintained and making progress, but may still have serious issues that need to
be fixed (e.g. SMS not working). Refer to the
[devices](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices) page for details.

[#latest release#] is recommended for best stability.

### Edge (Rolling Release)
[#grid end#]
Development happens in edge, the rolling release channel of postmarketOS.
Find downloads for devices in *main* and *community* categories
[here](https://images.postmarketos.org/bpo/edge/). To install postmarketOS to
one of the many
[devices in testing](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices#Testing)
or to customize your installation otherwise (e.g. install another user
interface), use *pmbootstrap* as explained in the
[installation guide](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Installation_guide).

Edge is recommended for development (latest features,
[occasional breakage](/edge/)).

## Notes

Make sure to read documentation about the user interfaces
([Phosh](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Phosh),
[Plasma Mobile](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Plasma_Mobile) and
[Sxmo](https://sr.ht/~mil/Sxmo/)). Default username is <code>user</code>,
default password is <code>147147</code>.
[SSH](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/SSH) can be enabled (disabled by
default). The first boot always takes longer, as the partition gets resized to
take up the whole storage.

### Installer image
Some devices also have a graphical installer image available. With this image,
you can set your own password, encrypt the installation and configure SSH. It
is also possible to install from the SD card to the internal storage.
