title: "Donate to postmarketOS"
---
postmarketOS has been in development since 2016, and was published in 2017.
The blog posts often cover shiny new features, but that is just the tip of the
iceberg. A significant amount of work and time has to be spent on reviewing and
testing incoming patches, analyzing and fixing bugs in all kinds of code bases,
packaging new software releases, upstreaming patches, answering to issues,
making sure that the infrastructure works, writing blog posts. Donations allow
us to keep postmarketOS afloat in all aspects, and to bring it into a bright
future where *you* control *your phone* again and not the other way around.

Donations are accepted through the NLnet Foundation via
[bank transfer](#bank-transfer) and
[other mechanisms](https://nlnet.nl/donating/foundation-form.html) (as of
writing *BTC, BCH, NMC, PayPal* and *credit card*). Depending on your region,
they are [tax deductible](#tax-information).

Please confirm your
donation by writing to **donation@nlnet.nl**. If you choose a different
method than bank transfer, then you must explicitly write that this donation
is intended for postmarketOS. You can add to the mail whether your donation is
anonymous (if not, please add **donation@postmarketos.org**).

Even small donations are useful, especially if you set them up as automatic
monthly transfer.

Thank you for considering a donation!
